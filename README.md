# forecasting-US-election-2020

This repo is dedicated for the prediction of the 2020 US presidential election results. We use Multi-Regression Post-Stratification technique to build a model on the available survey data and use the population census data to construct demographic cells and find the estimates for each cell. In the end, we weigh the relevant cell and arrive at an estimate of the proportion of US population would vote for Donald Trump.

The study is built upon two data sets:
1. Survey data - collected by the Voter Study Group. Specifinally, ns20200625 is used to construct the model.
2. Census data - collected by the IPUMS USA, University of Minnesota. Variables are selected accordingly.

Thank you for their diligent work on collecting massive data sets. 

Output includes the final report and cleaned data sets.
